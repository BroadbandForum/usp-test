   in its MQTT packets.
2. Send a Get message to the EUT with the following structure:

    ```{filter=pbv type=Msg}
    header {
        msg_id: '<msg_id>'
        msg_type: GET
    }
    body {
        request {
            get {
                param_paths: 'Device.DeviceInfo'
            }
        }
    }
    ```

3. Wait for the EUT to send a GetResponse.
4. Configure the Controller to include an MQTT Content Type property of
   `application/vnd.bbf.usp.msg` in its MQTT packets.
5. Send a Get message to the EUT with the following structure:

    ```{filter=pbv type=Msg}
    header {
        msg_id: '<msg_id>'
        msg_type: GET
    }
    body {
        request {
            get {
                param_paths: 'Device.DeviceInfo'
            }
        }
    }
    ```

3. Wait for the EUT to send a GetResponse.

### Test Metrics

1. The EUT must send a GetResponse for both Get messages, indicating that it
   processed the Controller's MQTT PUBLISH packets.

## 11.16 MQTT Connection Retry

### Purpose

The purpose of this test is to ensure the EUT retries its connection with the
MQTT server after the server terminates the connection.

### Functionality Tags

Conditional Mandatory (supports the MQTT MTP)

### Test Setup

1. Ensure the EUT is configured to use an MQTT server that exists
   in the test environment.

### Test Procedure

1. Send an MQTT DISCONNECT packet to the EUT.
2. Allow the EUT to start a new MQTT session with the MQTT server.

### Test Metrics

1. The EUT retries connecting to the MQTT server between ConnectRetryTime of the
   connection instance and
   ConnectRetryTime*(ConnectRetryIntervalMultiplier/1000).

## 11.17 MQTT - Use of Connect Record

### Purpose

The purpose of this test is to ensure the EUT correctly sends a Connect record
after it has established a communications channel to the controller.

### Functionality Tags

Conditional Mandatory (supports the MQTT MTP)

### Test Setup

1. Ensure the EUT is configured to use an MQTT server that exists
   in the test environment.

### Test Procedure


1. Reboot the EUT.
2. Wait for the EUT to establish an MQTT session with the MQTT server.

### Test Metrics

1. After reconnecting to the MQTT server, the EUT transmits an MQTTConnectRecord
   within 30 seconds. The EUT includes the MQTTVersion field set to the correct
   MQTT version and the subscribed_topic field set to a Topic that the EUT is
   subscribed to.
